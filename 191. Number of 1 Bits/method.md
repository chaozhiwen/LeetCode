<h3>Question</h3><br>
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).<br>
<h3>Method</h3><br>
1.transform integer to binary string<br>
2.traverse the bit of string<br>
<b>note:</b>the most bits of interger is 32
<h3>Algorithm Complexity</h3><br>
O(n)
