<h3>Question</h3>
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.<br>
<h3>Method</h3>
I made a mistake that i calculated power of two since 2.As computer,it's a pretty time-comsumig process,so the program exceeded the time limit.
But other way showed me that The binary numbers of all 2 integer powers only contains a 1.In other words,we just need to take modulo operation constantly,and count how many 1 in number
<h3>Algorithm Complexity</h3>
O(log n)
